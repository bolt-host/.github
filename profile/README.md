# ⚡ Bolt

**Bolt** is a powerful, open-source server software that empowers you to deploy and manage **self-hosted servers** in fully isolated **sandboxed environments** — quickly, securely, and with minimal overhead.

## 🔧 What Is Bolt?

Bolt is designed for developers, sysadmins, and power users who want full control over their infrastructure without relying on third-party hosting. Whether you're spinning up game servers, development environments, or containerized services, Bolt gives you a flexible and secure foundation.
